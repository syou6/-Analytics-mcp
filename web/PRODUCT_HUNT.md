### First Comment (Maker's Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share GitHub Analytics MCP with you all!

As a developer, I was always curious about my GitHub performance but found existing tools either too expensive (enterprise-focused) or too basic (just commit counts). 

So I built GitHub Analytics MCP - an AI-powered analytics platform specifically for individual developers like us.

What makes it special:
- 🤖 AI insights that tell you WHAT to improve, not just metrics
- 💰 Affordable pricing at ¥980/month (less than a coffee subscription!)
- 🌍 Available in 10+ languages
- 🚀 Zero setup - just login with GitHub

I'd love to hear your feedback and feature requests! The first 100 Product Hunt users get 3 months of Pro features for free with code: **PHUNT2025**

Ask me anything! 🙌
